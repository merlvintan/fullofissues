# Aikido Demo – Insecure SaaS App

This repository is intentionally insecure.

It simulates a fast-moving digital-native SaaS team that prioritised speed over security.
The goal is to demonstrate how Aikido identifies, prioritises, and explains real-world risks
across application code, dependencies, infrastructure, CI/CD, and secrets.

⚠️ Do NOT deploy this application to production.
